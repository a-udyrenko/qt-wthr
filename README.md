# The QT Weather App

- Designed and implemented from scratch by Anton Udyrenko
- This project is made for demo purposes
- Uses free OpenWeather API for [5 day weather forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
- Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## How to run locally

Everything is pretty simple and corresponds to the default "Create React App" settings.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
